		<h1>The Progression of the Revelation of the Kingdom and of the Messiah in Daniel</h1>
	</header>
	<ol>
		<li>A stone cut out without <em>human </em>hands crushes the kingdoms of the world and replaces them [Dan 2:34-35,45].
			<ol>
				<ol><li><strong><em>Key</em></strong><em>: The materials represent both king and kingdom [Dan 2:37-39,40-42,44]</em></li></ol>
				<li>The Kingdom of Stone, the Kingdom of God is of Heavenly origin.</li>
				<li>Its King is not of human origin</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>One like unto a Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven entering heaven and receiving authority over all the world [Dan 7:13]
			<ol>
				<li><strong><em>Key</em></strong><em>: &ldquo;One like unto a Son of Man&rdquo; indicates that he is not a man but only looks like one. [cf., Dan 8:15; 10:16; Eze 1:26; Rev 14:14]</em></li>
				<li>The King of the Last Kingdom, the &ldquo;One like unto a Son of Man&rdquo;, is not <em>really </em>human</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>The little horn opposing the Prince of the Host, the Prince of Princes and being destroyed without human power [Dan 8:10-11,25; 2Th 2:8]
			<ol>
				<li><strong><em>Key</em></strong><em>: </em><em>The host of heavens, the stars, here are the people of Israel (and not angels) [Gen 15:5; 22:17-18; 26:4-5; 37:9; </em><em>Exo 6:26; 7:4; 12:41; </em><em>Jos 5:13-15</em><em>; Dan 8:24</em><em>; Rev 12:1-4]</em></li>
				<li>The Prince of the Host that is opposed by the &ldquo;little horn&rdquo; is the Prince of Israel,</li>
				<li>The Prince of the Host of Israel is the &ldquo;Prince of Princes&rdquo; [Dan 8:25],</li>
				<li>The temple belongs to the Prince of the Host [Dan 8:11],</li>
				<li>The Prince of the Host is not human&mdash;the &ldquo;little horn&rdquo; opposing him will be destroyed by non-human power [Dan 8:25]</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>The Anointed One the Prince coming to Jerusalem after 69 sevens and being cut off
			<ol>
				<li>The ruler we are expecting is &ldquo;One like unto a Son of Man&rdquo;, yet, that he could be cut off means that he was human.</li>
				<li>Therefore, this divine person must have become human.</li>
				<li>But the fact that he eventually rules the kingdom, as stated in the earlier prophecies [Dan 2:45; 7:13], means that he wouldn&rsquo;t stay cut-off</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><em>Michael is revealed to be the Prince of Israel</em>
			<ol>
				<li>Michael arises, there is great tribulation and the saints are resurrected [Dan 12:1-4]</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
